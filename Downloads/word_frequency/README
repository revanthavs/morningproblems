#   Weekly Exercise 3: Word Frequency
# --------------------------------------------

INCLUDED FILES:
freq.py
README

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS:

Imported sys module to get access command line arguments

Functions in freq.py:
command_line():
open_file()
word_list()
words_freq()
data_output()
main()

(command_line)
First the program will take the commanline arguments and make them a list.
If the user forget to include inputfile name the error will be printed and program exits.
If the user included more than just inpurfile the error will be printed and program exits.
(open_file)
If the inputfile is in same directory as freq.py the file opens if they are not in same directory 
the excpetion of File not found will be raised and the program exits
(word_list)
Ones the file is opend the content of the file will be read line by line and will be divided into
words and stored in as list and ones all words were added to list they will be sorted by using
Build-in method "sort()" and will be returned as a sorted list
(words_freq)
After the the file content were sorted we can see that the in the sorted list if a word repetes then
the word will be a sequence in the list till the number of time the word will be repeted.
Since the word were in list of sequence ordered we can find the count of word by counting the 
starting and ending index of the list and the word, it's count and it's relative frequency will be added
to three different lists with same index.
(data_output)
Since all the three lists(words,word_count,word_freq) has the same index they will be added to the output
file and the output file will be closed ones all the items are added.
(main)
All the process above will be happened inside the main block and ones all were done the input file will be closed
